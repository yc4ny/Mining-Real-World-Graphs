In recent years, real world graphs have emerged and are growing exponentially. To analyze real world graphs, partitioning them into smaller groups is necessary due to its massive size in terms of memory and computational power consumption. Therefore, how can we cut them \textit{fast} and \textit{nicely}? We built a method to partition the real world graph data by combining \textit{label propagation} algorithm and \textit{Kernighan-Lin} algorithm. As the experiment result shows, the pipeline of these two algorithms results in faster running time of graph partitioning than using only one method.
